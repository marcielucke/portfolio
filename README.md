## Description

This is a portfolio of my current web development work. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I move throughout my bootcamp course. The current goal of my portfolio is creating a place to house my work, practice my skills, and keep track of my learning in the UT coding bootcamp. This project gave me a chance to practice both my HTML and CSS skills in a creative, but technical manner. It also gave me a chance to practice making a draft for a website and working from there.
